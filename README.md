# electoral-college

In the United States, the people do not directly 
vote for President. The Founding Fathers believed that
a true democracy was subject to the rule of factions
and mob rule. The electoral college, they believed,
would protect against this. Instead of having each
person's vote count towards the President, each state
receives a certain number of electoral votes. The 
number of electoral votes for each state is equal 
to the number of members of congress for that state 
(the number of senators, plus the number of 
representatives). When the 23rd Amendment was ratified 
in 1961, Washington D.C. was also given electoral votes, 
but not to exceed the lowest number of votes that a 
state has -- this has usually limited D.C. to 3 votes."),
h3("The data for the United States general elections was 
found from a Github repository which included multiple 
government datasets (https://github.com/zonination/election-history). 

Elections that were contested were 
labelled with asterisks in this dataset, so I amended 
the dataset with the wikipedia data set found here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College. 
The population data for the states are based off of the 
United States Census, conducted every 10 years. This 
dataset was found from a GitHub repository with historical
data (https://github.com/ropensci/historydata/blob/master/data-raw/nhgis0011_ts_state.csv).

Per political historians, it is widely believed that
there was a party realignment during the Presidency of
Franklin D. Roosevelt. As such, the comparisons made
between the Democratic and Republican Parties only
include the years from 1932 to 2016.

This project seeks to investigate whether or not the Electoral 
College truly helps Republicans, as many have argued in recent
years.
